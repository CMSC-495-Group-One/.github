# Task Management Project

Welcome to the Task Management project. This README will guide you on how to set up Postman, import our Postman collection, and get started with running our API and UI locally. We also provide information on how to use our Jira Kanban board and Slack Channel.

## Jira Kanban Board

Our team uses a Jira Kanban Board to manage and track the progress of our work.
